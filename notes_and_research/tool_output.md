# Tool Output

## Representation

In terms of the representation of the tool, I'm not overly bothered by it (at the moment). I'm thinking a simple command line tool, allowing you to enter the stage of competition, table cards and pocket cards. Something like:

```zsh
Enter the stage of the competition (preflop 'p', flop 'f', river 'r', turn 't'): f
Enter the first community card: 6h
Enter the second community card: qd
Enter the third community card: 3s
     ---    ---   ---   ---
Enter your first pocket card: qs
Enter your second pocket card: jh
     ---    ---   ---   ---
Calculating prediction...
Your predicted win percentage is: 63.27%
Go for it, you can win this pot!
